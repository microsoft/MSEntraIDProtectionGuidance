# MS Entra ID Protection Guidance

A Microsoft open-source initiative aimed at helping defender teams to arm responders with the knowledge to properly respond to compromise of Microsoft Entra Tenants. Although some example hunting queries for Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR Advanced Hunting are provided in this guidance, the advice and recommendations are designed to be used by anyone, regardless of security technology stack. This guidance should be shared with internal response teams or incident response partners.
